        <title>Forgotten Passwords</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgotten Your Password? Yes. Yes, I have forgotten my password. Yes, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always forget my passwords and have to click the forgotten your password link. I resent the wording of “forgotten your password?” as it implies that I’m the one at fault. Gimme a break! The truth of the matter is that as a website user I can’t win. If I pick a nice simple combination of letters and maybe numbers that I can remember easily I’m told that it’s not secure enough; if I pick something suitably complicated or random then I can’t remember it, especially when I’m not supposed to use the same password across multiple sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want our accounts to be secure and, at the same time, we want the convenience of not having to jump through a multitude of hoops just to log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the option of picking a simple, memorable password isn’t even an option any more. Your password now has to contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, a number and a symbol. How long before you have to type it in blindfolded while standing on one leg?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what actually happens, every time, is that I have 3 or 4 attempts to guess what password I might have used before having to click the forgotten password link. This goes to a new screen which asks me for my email address, again, even though I’ve just tried it several times. I then wait for an email to arrive before clicking a link in the message to back to a screen where I can reset my password. I type in some new soon to be forgotten combination and I’m finally in, usually about 5 minutes after I started. Several times I’ve either run out of time or decided what ever I wanted to do just isn’t worth the hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some very secure systems make you change your password every month. Oh thanks. Yeah, that’s helping. And don’t even think about going back to a password you’ve used before. Does anyone really change their password properly each month or do they just increment one digit making it really easy to guess from one month to the next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;Keys?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering a password is fundamentally just me proving my identity by giving a piece of information, a combination of letters, numbers and symbols that nobody else could know. I have something unique which grants me access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other parts of life we approach gaining access differently. We secure our precious homes using a physical key. We actually put a piece of metal into a door and turn it, as we have for centuries. It seems quite crude for the 21st century but it’s simple and it works. We can spend our money by using a physical card and entering a four digit PIN. The PIN is easy to remember - it’s only four digits and you can keep the same digits for years. It’s the combination of something physical and a very simple password which makes it secure and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why’ve we made gaining online access to things so different? I’m not saying we should all have keys for our devices but an element of the physical could certainly come into play. If our web devices had the ability to read from something physical then we could use the same approach. Hackers would not be able to replicate the physical aspect quickly enough to make it viable to hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;partial-solutions&quot;&gt;Partial Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the answer? There is software which will remember passwords for you. Most decent web browers offer to remember passwords and there are other programs or apps which will allow you access your password list once you enter a master password. The problem with these is that they’re specific to one device and that’s just not necessarily how we do things now. During a typical day I’ll use a work desktop PC, a laptop, a phone and a tablet and I may want to access the same info from any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest I’ve seen to an automated solution is to use the same browser across all devices, assuming this is possible, and allow it to remember and sync passwords. Chrome and Firefox offer this. As far as I know the passwords are not stored in the cloud but actually within the browser on each device. My worry is that a site or app could try to immitate the sync process and steal all your password data. I’m sure it’s pretty secure but anything that stores passwords is going to get the attention of hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about writing down all your passwords in a notebook? Sounds stupid at first but as there aren’t hoards of bad guys actively trying to steal it it’s probably one of the safer options. The difficulty is keeping it with you and never losing it. It could fall into the wrong hands and easily expose you to problems from people not clever enough to be hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the key to balancing security and convenience is to weigh up how secure access to a site needs to be and how often you use it. Think “if someone got in what’s the worst they could they do?”. With the convenient “forgotten your password” service provided by most sites, if someone has your email address and password they can actually get into pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guard-your-email&quot;&gt;Guard your Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat your email address as top priority. Choose a horrible, hard to remember password and make the effort to learn it. Don’t use this password for anything else. If you log into the email provider’s site or app, don’t let your browser or device remember the password - make the effort to type it in each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-creative-with-your-passwords&quot;&gt;Get Creative with your Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some fun things you can do to make seemingly random combinations more memorable. None of this is particularly new and won’t fool any serious hackers but it might help meet the increasingly tough password requirements for day to day stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-numbers-and-symbols-as-letters&quot;&gt;Use numbers and symbols as letters&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>What I Learned in 2014: Part 3 - The Best of the Rest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the final part of a three-part article looking back on new things I’ve discovered in 2014. This part is just a round up of all the other bits and pieces not mentioned in the other parts and a bit of a look forward to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;google-analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used Analytics for years but haven’t really used it in any depth for the last couple of years. It’s changed. Quite a lot. All in a good way. It can do a lot more now than before. It seems to be moving closer towards the Webmaster Tools and used well can actually help you improve not only the user experience through design but also the performance of your site through the Behaviour &amp;gt; Page Speed data and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aspnet-mvc&quot;&gt;ASP.NET MVC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t do a lot server side but colleagues of mine have made excellent use of the EditorFor functionality and partial views to ceate reuseable dynamic page components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest discovery has been Bundling and Minification of JavaScript and CSS assets. It allows you to create bundles of files and then concatenates them into one long file before minifying it and changing the references. This could mean one single request for all JavaScript, which is then cached - much better for performance and page loading times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsive-web-design&quot;&gt;Responsive Web Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still feel like I’m quite new to this but have made some good progress this year. I now understand the basics of mobile and viewport sizing and scaling. I’ve also got the hang of media queries for changing font-sizes and positions of elements based on screen width. I’ve kind of taught myself by looking at the code of sites that do it well rather than by using any tutorials. It seems to be a good shortcut for now. There’s definitely a lot more to learn here but I’m pleased how painless it’s been so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brackets&quot;&gt;Brackets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started using Adobe Brackets, which is an open source code editor available from brackets.io. It’s got everything I need, looks good and from the progress I’ve seen in its first few months it’s going to move pretty fast. The thing I love about it is that it’s built in front end technologies - HTML, CSS and Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-do-list-for-2015&quot;&gt;To Do List for 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now I see how much I’ve learned in the last year it’s time to start thinking about what’s next for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious area for me is learning more about SVG. It would be nice to reach a point where any graphic that isn’t a photo could be created in CSS or SVG. I’d quite like to move away from icon font libraries in favour of SVGs to reduce a bit of bloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big area is responsive web design, in particular responsive images. Sending large images to mobile devices is bad news and should be a quick win on the performance front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there will be a lot more that crops up in 2015 as I find a need for it and I may even start learning things that haven’t even been created yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I can help others to learn more too in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I Learned in 2014: Part 2 - Javascript and Google Maps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of a three-part article looking back at what new web things I’ve learned in 2014. This part focuses on JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;javascript-and-jquery&quot;&gt;JavaScript and jQuery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big area, probably the area where I have made the most progress in the last year. The main shift for me has been from doing everything in jQuery, which I learned first, to using native JavaScript. Hopefully by learning to do more with native Javascript I can cut down on the jQuery bloat, especially in mobile friendly pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “vanilla JavaScript” I’ve learnt to use a few new built-in functions, which perform very well in modern browsers. One of the things that really slows down a page’s performance in JavaScript is looping through a long list of items and performing various operations within each. I’ve learned four new functions which perform operations very quickly - map, filter, forEach and reduce. I would urge anyone using standard for loops to look into these. One for loop operation I tried on a list of 10,000 items killed Chrome. Switching to using map it worked in under a second. I believe that jQuery’s each and filter functions already leverage these bult-in functions. The other useful thing I’ve discovered when working with loops is to move anything you can outside of the loop, e.g. a function. Don’t declare it every time - just do it once and call it each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve finally got the hang of the ternary operator. This just means that I can now write my conditional statements in a much more compact way, things like return (confirmed) ? true : false;. If the variable ‘confirmed’ is truthy, return true, otherwise return false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great discovery in the last couple of months has been the hashchange event. The browser can detect changes to the part of the URL that appears after the #. This means that when we use links to change something like filter the data in a table, instead of the link’s href bring empty or set to the meaningless “#”, we can put something meaningful in there. For example our href could be “#female” and the URL will change to reflect this. The haschange event will listen for this change and we can then grab the part after the hash symbol using window.location.hash and do our filtering. This has the added bonus of appearing in the browser’s history so the user can hit their back button to undo a filter. Much better and feels like this is how it’s supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve now understood how to properly use functions and objects in JavaScript to set the appropriate scope for variables. Wrapping functionality in functions means that each function is its own self-contained unit, which means no unexpected or conflicting references cropping up and it makes the code easier to maintain and test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I wrote a jQuery script to handle pagination in a HTML table. I won’t go ito the horribly complicated detail here but the learning point for me was to get the logic clear in my mind before getting into the code. I actually went back to pen and paper, sketching out the various scenarios and then finding the patterns to create my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript Frameworks and jQuery Plugins
Thanks to a very patient colleague I’ve now got a much better grip on Angular.js. I can now work with not just binding data in the HTML but can also write directives to create new page components and services to handle commonly required functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Angular work I’ve also learned how to do Unit Testing using the Jasmine framework. Unit testing always felt like a lot of extra work to me but now I see that having a long list of small tests that run is invaluable. It gives you the freedom to write new code knowing that any knock-on effects you create in the process will be picked up. It makes for far more robust and less buggy code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve implemented 2 jQuery plugins into a project, tablesorter for automatically sorting the rows of a table by clicking on a column heading, and elevateZoom for adding the capability of zooming in on a thumbnail image, like we often see on clothing details pages. Both are very well written with a lot of options available. Using these has made me realise that I can now go ito the code of the plugins and actually follow (more or less) what is going on. I hope to be able to write and share some of my own in the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;google-maps-api-v3&quot;&gt;Google Maps API v.3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve now spent a few months working with this API and have got a good understanding of how it works and how it can be used and extended to do more. I created my own utility library of functions for all the things I need to do regularly - draw markers and polygons with info windows which appear on click, calculating areas, converting area units, adding data layers and heatmaps, encoding/decoding polygon paths, adding new map controls, etc. There was also some more advanced functionality in there too which goes beyond what’s included in the API - calculating the optimal bounds (map viewport) to show a number of polygons, determining the direction or winding (clockwise or anti/counter-clockwise) of a polygon, calculating the centroid (centre from the average coordinates of points) of a polygon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also used some third party features to extend the mapping functionality. One of these has allowed me to cluster markers so rather than have a lot of marekrs close together on screen we show a number of markers, much neater. Another has enabled me to place text labels on the map, which isn’t possible out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key tricks that I have picked up along the way are to 1) push any markers or polygons into an array so you can access them easily in JavaScript and 2) add your own custom properties to the native objects for markers and polygons, e.g. id or name, so that you can identify them easily in code.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I Learned in 2014: Part 1 - HTML, CSS, Fonts and Images</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d take a look back through all the new tech that I’ve learnt in 2014. Most of it is genuinely learning new things from scratch but some is polishing up on things I haven’t used for a while or taking things further than I had before. It’s a much longer list than I had expected so I’ve broken it down into 3 articles. Hopefully, it’ll be handy to come back to in the future when I’ve forgotten it all again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;html&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve discovered a couple of new things in HTML5. As they’re APIs I uess they’re really Javascript more than HTML. I’ve learned a bit about the Speech API - speech synthesis (turning text content into audio) and speech recognition (turning microphone input into text). It’s still early days and, at the time of writing, only works in Chrome but has some exciting possibilities for both greater accessibility and the ability to use the web without having to look at a page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other discovery this year has been the progress element for adding a progress bar to a page. All browsers make these look very different by default but it’s not too hard to style them for consistency if that’s what you want. Like many other HTML5 elements it has nice fallback syntax for non HTML5 browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;css&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d previously only used transitions for adding a bit of a delay into hover effects but it’s great for changing the size or position or page elements too. It works very nicely combined with transform:rotate. I’ve actually found a great practical use for transitions in creating a multi-state button, which changes from displaying “Save” to “Saving…” and then “Saved” with different styling for each state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now learned how to do proper keyframe animations in CSS without the need for any Javascript. The possibilities are endless. Just need to make sure I’m not chucking them in everywhere for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve had to deal with print media styling. I was hoping things would have improved in the last few years but still find it quite tricky. I found myself having to use a lot of !important in my properties to gain control. Maybe considering print later in the design process rather than from the outset was a mistake with hindsight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fonts&quot;&gt;Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started making full use of web fonts, particularly Google Fonts. The basic implementation is very easy, just a link to an external CSS file which loads the font-face, but they’re not always consistent across operating systems and browsers so it takes quite a bit of testing to be sure your chosen font will appear nicely across the board. Working out whether to install additional font variants for bold and italic or whether to just let the browser apply its own faux bold and italic effects is another issue. Given the extra HTTP requests and page weight I’m tending to stick with “web safe” fonts for body text and only use web fonts for headings or elements requiring a bit more styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that I can actually create my own font variants by playing around with the CSS letter-spacing property, using things like letter-spacing:-1px, on “web safe” fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t learned much new with images but have found a couple of handy new techniques. I’ve started using base64 format for smaller images instead of referencing external files. This means putting the file data into a continuous stream of characters in the CSS file instead of using a path another file. This still gets cached as part of the CSS but prevents an additional HTTP request. As base64 format is actually a little bigger in file size than refreencing the image directly it only makes sense for smaller files. For larger files it makes more sense to benefit from the smaller file size at the expense of the extra request. Good CSS editors will also show you a preview of the image as you hover over the base654 code, which is handy as it’s completely unintelligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve started using some very basic SVG. It seems fairly straightforward but I’m still not sure about the sizing and scaling. One for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What&#39;s Wrong with England</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with the England football team? Why haven’t the senior men’s team won any major tournaments since 1966? What needs to change to increase the chances of success in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read quite a few articles, watch the pundits on TV, listen to radio shows and podcasts and the various ex-players and journalists continuously come up with the same reasons why England have “underperformed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not wholly convinced by any of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;club-vs-country&quot;&gt;Club vs. Country&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard it said that players don’t want to play for England. There may have been one or two instances with meaningless friendlies ahead of major league ties but for the most part I don’t buy this as an argument. I think it’s every footballer’s dream to be playing for his country in the major tounaments. That said, I’ve never understood players “retiring from international football”. I don’t see any shame in naturally falling out of favour and being replaced by younger players. If Joey Barton can “retire”, well, I may as well declare myself out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poor-quality-coaching&quot;&gt;Poor Quality Coaching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure about this one either. Whilst I have to admit that improving coaching at grass roots level can only be a positive thing for the long term future of English football, I don’t see that there’s some major problem. We have lots of very promising young players emerging. Talented players come in waves. Always have, always will. Just like you get strong years and weaker years in school pupils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing well internationally is partly down to luck in having a strong group all coming through at once. Just look at the Belgium line up now and compare it to the squads they had at the last few tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-english-in-the-premier-league&quot;&gt;More English in the Premier League&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many blame the high number of foreign players in the Premier League. I keep hearing different numbers but I think currently somewhere around 35% of Premier League players are English. If 20 teams have 25 players registered for the league, 500 players, that’s a pool of 175 English players from which to find a squad of 23. Increasing the quota of English players and adding to this pool wouldn’t push up the quality, only the quantity. In reality, this isn’t the extent of the pool anyway as English players playing in other leagues are also eligible. If the quota was increased they would be the same players. Playing well in the Championship or in a foreign league must be better than being a benchwarmer in the Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hibernation&quot;&gt;Hibernation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, our players are tired at the end of a long season and we need a winter break to magically make it all better. I struggle to see how having a couple of weeks off in December or January has much impact on how players are feeling by the end of May. The “experts” always claim that the German and Spanish leagues have a winter break and that gives them an advantage. Well, on the evidence of the 2014 World Cup, one won it and the other went home early. Hardly conclusive evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the commercial activity around pre season tours, do people really think that the players would get a break? Or would they be flown out to the UAE to play in exhibition matches?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-so-good-tekkers&quot;&gt;Not So Good Tekkers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a view that English players lack technical skill, that we’re not as good technically as the Spanish or the South Americans. I can see that some nations do seem to thrive on close control and are able to keep possession under pressure much better than England. Chile, in particular, have been masters of keeping possession in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this sort of possession game can be highly effective and getting better at this would certainly be a benefit, I see little point in England trying to play these nations at their own game. If we play a side like Spain or Chile and try to dominate possession we will be humiliated. It makes more sense to use other tactics. Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid was able to overcome Barcelona by playing a more physical game - adapting for the opposition. Germany don’t especially play a possession game - they focus on counter attcking, moving the ball very quickly when their opponents are most vulnerable. Technical skill is to be admired but it’s not the only route to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germanic-panic&quot;&gt;Germanic Panic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard a lot of football experts praising the revolution in German football, the way Klinsmann and Loew created a national identity and way of playing which is consistent between the clubs and the national side. I’m a little sceptical. I struggle to see how all clubs can play in the same style and still compete. Surely experimenting with styles and tactics is a major part of trying to gain an advantage on your competition? The other part which doesn’t quite convince me is that Germany have always been a major force in international tournaments. The World Cup in Brazil may have been the first they’ve won since 1990 but they’ve never been far away. They’re consistently in the semi-finals of most tournaments, revolution or no revolution. Where I do think they’ve got it right is fitting the players to a system, not shoe-horning a system around popular players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;well&quot;&gt;Well?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they’re looking at it all wrong. I think there are other, much simpler reasons behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ftw-maybe-ftd&quot;&gt;FTW! Maybe FTD?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a league a team with a strong attack but weaker defence can still do well. A prime example is Liverpool finishing second in the 2013/2014 season. A team more focused on attacking and hoping to outscore their opponent is likely to pick up more wins over the course of a season. In a tournament this kind of gamble can see you quickly knocked out. Your luck will run out at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst scoring goals helps to win games, having a weak defence helps to lose them. However, having a watertight defence can at least ensure a draw and give a chance of progressing through penalty shootouts. Thinking about recent tournaments most eventual winners either progressed through penalties or extra time at some point. I can’t remember the last time a winner won all their games in normal time. So, there’s definitely an element of playing it safe and hoping for a bit of luck. It’s also human nature. Every international team is under huge pressure from fans and the media. Being eliminated from a tournament in extra time or penalties feels more like bad luck than poor performance so is somehow more respectable. If you’re going to be knocked out it’s better to go this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, England went out after 2 games because they were poor defensively. Everyone knew that going into the tournament. It was probably the weakest back 4 we’ve ever had going into a World Cup and so it’s not a great shock that it’s the earliest we’ve ever been knocked out. Theoretically, in competitions with 32 teams and assuming you qualify from the group stage, if you play ultra-defensively, enough to keep each knockout match at 0-0 and bring it down to a 50/50 shootout, you have a 1 in 16 chance of winning the tournament. So, that’s a tournament win every 32 years. Hard to actually pull off but it worked for Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;youre-the-weakest-link&quot;&gt;You’re the Weakest Link&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team’s only as good as its weakest player. In major tournaments there’s always a massive focus on the big star players but football statistics bear out the fact that results are dictated by teams’ weaknesses rather than their strengths. If there’s any weakness at this level it will be exploited and is likely to influence the outcome of a game. It’s not necessarily the teams with the big names who do well at major tournaments but those with the fewest holes. England have certainly gone into the last few tournaments with known weaknesses - players in unfamiliar roles, defence not being used to playing together, lack of goal threat, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-grass-is-always-greener&quot;&gt;The Grass is Always Greener&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever any team does badly or fails to live up to expectation they look for the knee-jerk reaction and to do the opposite of what they did before. England appointed Fabio Capello, a manager with an amazing track record in club football. After “failing” at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa - knee-jerk - the next manager must be English. Personally, I feel much more comfortable having an English manager but I don’t believe it is any more or any less likely to lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prime example of the grass always being greener is Brazil. After the humiliating way in which they were knocked out of the World Cup on home soil, playing very attacking football, they’ve knee-jerked by appointing Dunga, a very defensive pragmatist. The same happened following their loss to Uruguay in the 1950 final. They abandoned their exciting exhibitionist style and went on the defensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-answer&quot;&gt;What’s the Answer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t think we’ve actually got anything that wrong. We just need to bide our time and need that bit of luck in the latter stages. Is the answer trying to find a quick fix through special FA committees? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>If Facebook had a Yawn Button</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the moment Facebook has 3 ways you can interact with posts: Like, Comment and Share. All three of these do slighty different things but they all contribute towards a post’s popularity score, which determines how likely it is to appear in people’s news streams. It makes a lot of sense for users to be shown content that people like or interact with (comments could be negative) rather than content people are indifferent to. In short, it’s a system designed to reward and promote interesting content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is cleverer than this. It records which other users you interact with most and gives their future psts priority in your stream so you see more from those people you have historically found interesting. Good job Facebook barons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we need the opposite, a way of penalising and demoting the content that we find boring. The way I imagine it working is having a Yawn link with the other options. The main difference with this one is that it would have to be anonymous. We don’t want people to be offended, cause tension or break up friendships. It’s also not intended as a way of judging the quality of other people’s content - what one person finds interesting might be boring to someone else or maybe it’s an in-joke that they just don’t get. It’s about filtering the right content for the right people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issue with Facebook right now is that everyone just broadcasts everything to everyone, nothing is targeted. When you write a post you have the option to decide who sees it. You can select individuals, exclude individuals or set up your friends in groups and choose which see it and which don’t. But nobody does. It’s very odd. Think of the last thing you posted on Facebook. Imagine taking that content and putting it into an email and sending it to everyone in your address book. You wouldn’t. I’m sure even though most outgoing people would maybe untick one or two contacts. And this all means that we end up reading lots of content that really isn’t ever meant for us. And the whole Facebook experience becomes irrelevant and ultimately boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I post something and it gets 1 Like but 20 Yawns it’ll make me think twice about posting something like that again. But I thought everyone was into learning JavaScript frameworks? I guess you’re all just weirdos. :) What it will do is, the next time I’m enthusiastic about some nerdy tech thing, it’ll make me think about who might be interested and I’ll share it just with them. In this particular case, there’s a fair chance it’ll be nobody but that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two of my favourite bubble blowing dragons, Bub and Bob, from the 1987 game Bubble Bobble recreated in Lego with help from my 8 year old son, Oliver.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My New Website</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of working on all sorts of websites I thought I’d create my own personal site. I’ve created quite a few sites for myself before but they have always been about my web design and development work or (failed) entrepreneurial attemps to generate a bit of money. This is different. I’m not looking to gain any money, work or reputation, just giving myself a platform to publish, well, whatever the hell I feel like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what will go on it yet, maybe a bit of a blog, maybe some articles, photos, video, music. Or I might just fill pages with adverts and animated GIFs. Seems to work for some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-design&quot;&gt;The Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d just share some of the thinking and technical approach behind the design. As a web designer/developer I don’t want the site to be just about its content, I see it as a bit of a playground for trying out new design ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with I’ve focused on keeping the design as clean, clear and simple as possible. It’s fully responsive so works on devices of all shapes and sizes. I’ve also kept the technology involved to a minimum serving up static HTML files for maximum speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forwards I’m sure I’ll play around with different design ideas so not all pages will look the same. We’ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough. Hope you enjoy. Now go and do something more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
